# Test-Driven Development in Python

This is an example project implementing the well-known Tic Tac Toe game in
Python in a a test-driven way.  It is used as an example for teaching about
test-driven development and the red-green-refactor process in my university
courses.

The example is adapted from Garcia and Farcic's book *Test-Driven Java
Development*.

The last refactoring step is missing, many things could be improved there.  The
purpose of the example is, however, not to show how to refactor, or how to have
the cleanest implementation possible, but to illustrate the process.  Thus I
leave it at the current stage and do not apply any further refactorings.
