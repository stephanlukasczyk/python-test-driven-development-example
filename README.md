# Test-Driven Development in Python

This is an example project implementing the well-known Tic Tac Toe game in
Python in a a test-driven way.  It is used as an example for teaching about
test-driven development and the red-green-refactor process in my university
courses.

The example is adapted from Garcia and Farcic's book *Test-Driven Java
Development*.
